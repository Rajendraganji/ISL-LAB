# Look at the data using the fix() function. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university. We don't really want R to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to have these names for later. Try the following commands:
rownames(clg)=clg[,1]
fix(clg)
head(clg)

rownames(clg) = clg[, 1]
head(clg)

# Use the summary() function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set.
